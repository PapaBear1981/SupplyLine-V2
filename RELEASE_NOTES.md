## Version 5.1.0 - Barcode System Refactoring & Inventory Enhancements (2025-11-06)

### 🚀 MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS RELEASE

This release introduces a professional PDF-based barcode system, kit-only expendables management, child lot tracking for partial chemical issuances, and numerous UI/UX improvements. The barcode system has been completely refactored to use WeasyPrint for magazine-quality labels with support for multiple label sizes.

### 🏷️ Professional PDF-Based Barcode System

#### New Barcode Infrastructure
- **WeasyPrint Integration**: High-quality PDF generation from HTML/CSS templates
- **Vector Graphics**: SVG-based barcodes (python-barcode) and QR codes (segno) for crisp printing at any resolution
- **Multiple Label Sizes**: 4x6, 3x4, 2x4, 2x2 inches with responsive content scaling
- **Professional Design**: Magazine-quality typography and layout optimized for printing
- **Future-Ready**: Designed for Zebra printer compatibility while supporting standard PDF printing

#### Unified Barcode API
- **GET /api/barcode/tool/:id** - Generate tool label PDF
  - Query params: `label_size` (4x6, 3x4, 2x4, 2x2), `code_type` (barcode, qrcode)
- **GET /api/barcode/chemical/:id** - Generate chemical label PDF
  - Additional params: `is_transfer`, `parent_lot_number`, `destination`
- **GET /api/barcode/expendable/:id** - Generate expendable label PDF
  - Query params: `label_size`, `code_type`

#### Frontend Barcode Components
- **Centralized Barcode Service** (`barcodeService.js`): Single service for all barcode PDF generation
- **Updated Components**: ChemicalBarcode, ToolBarcode, ExpendableBarcode, KitItemBarcode
- **Automatic Printing**: Barcode modals appear after transfers and partial issuances

### 📦 Kit-Only Expendables System

#### New Expendable Model
- **Direct Kit Storage**: Add consumables directly to kits without warehouse management overhead
- **Lot/Serial Validation**: Mutually exclusive lot or serial number tracking
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Complete REST API for expendable management

- **Parent-Child Lineage**: Complete tracking with `parent_lot_number` field
- **Lot Sequence Counter**: Track number of child lots created from each parent
- **Immediate Barcode Printing**: Automatic barcode modal for new child lots

#### Lot Number Auto-Generation
