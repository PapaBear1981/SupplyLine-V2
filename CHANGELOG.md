# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Trusted device tokens for 2FA.** Users who complete TOTP or backup-code
  verification can opt in to "Trust this device for 30 days" so subsequent
  logins from that device skip the 2FA challenge (password is still required).
  Trusted devices can be listed and revoked from **Profile → Trusted Devices**
  and are automatically revoked on password change, admin password reset, and
  TOTP disable. Configure via `TRUSTED_DEVICE_TTL_DAYS` and
  `TRUSTED_DEVICE_MAX_PER_USER`. Run `python backend/migrations/add_trusted_devices.py`
  after upgrading.

### Fixed

- Backup-code login (`POST /api/auth/totp/verify-backup-code`) no longer crashes
  with `JWTManager has no attribute 'from_config'`; it now issues tokens via the
  shared `JWTManager.generate_tokens()` helper.
