# Feature Specification: Update Specification to Create a Comprehensive Security Review of the Current Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-specification-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Update specification to create a comprehensive security review of the current application."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Define the security review blueprint (Priority: P1)
A security program lead drafts a comprehensive review blueprint detailing scope, controls, timelines, and responsible parties for evaluating the SupplyLine MRO Suite.

**Why this priority**: A precise blueprint is required to align teams and ensure the review covers all critical surfaces before evidence collection begins.

**Independent Test**: Auditor verifies the blueprint document lists review scope, control catalog, evidence sources, timeline, and owner assignments without gaps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the latest security artefacts (`SECURITY.md`), **When** the security lead drafts the blueprint, **Then** it enumerates all mandatory controls (authentication, authorization, logging, data protection, dependency hygiene) with evaluation criteria and evidence locations.
2. **Given** the review calendar, **When** the blueprint is completed, **Then** it assigns accountable owners and due dates for each control assessment and references required tooling or logs.

---

### User Story 2 - Collect evidence and assess controls (Priority: P2)
Security analysts and service owners gather evidence, execute tests, and record findings against each control in the blueprint.

**Why this priority**: Evidence collection validates that documented controls operate as intended and surfaces risks requiring remediation.

**Independent Test**: Reviewer confirms every control in the blueprint has supporting evidence (logs, test results, configuration snapshots) and an assessment outcome.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the blueprint control list, **When** analysts perform assessments, **Then** they attach evidence artifacts, note pass/fail status, and capture severity-aligned findings for any deviations.
2. **Given** findings are recorded, **When** the review session concludes, **Then** the evidence repository indicates whether compensating controls or additional validation is needed before final reporting.

---

### User Story 3 - Report outcomes and track remediation (Priority: P3)
Security leadership compiles the review results, communicates risk ratings to stakeholders, and initiates tracked remediation actions.

**Why this priority**: A consolidated report with actionable remediation ensures identified risks are prioritized, resourced, and verified.

**Independent Test**: Governance reviewer can open the final report to see prioritized findings, remediation owners, target dates, and alignment to compliance obligations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** control assessments are complete, **When** the final security review report is produced, **Then** it summarizes overall risk posture, high/medium findings, and required approvals from security, engineering, and operations leadership.
2. **Given** remediation items are identified, **When** the tracker is published, **Then** each item has an owner, target resolution date, and follow-up verification method tied to relevant release artefacts (e.g., `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).

---

### Edge Cases

- Critical evidence sources (logs, monitoring dashboards) are unavailable or incomplete during assessment windows.
- Conflicting findings arise between automated scans and manual analyst reviews.
- New regulatory mandates appear mid-review, requiring scope expansion and rapid blueprint updates.
- Business-critical features are frozen for other initiatives, delaying remediation beyond planned timelines.

## Security & Compliance Impact *(mandatory)*

- No new secrets are introduced; review artifacts must reference existing credential management documented in `SECURITY.md` and confirm adherence during assessment.
- The review must verify rate limiting, password lifecycle, session handling, and data sanitization controls mandated by the constitution and `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
- Observability requirements include capturing log redaction proofs, alert coverage, and exception handling alignment as described in `ENHANCED_ERROR_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- Deliverables must meet audit readiness expectations for internal governance and any external certifications targeted by the program.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The security review blueprint MUST define scope, control objectives, evidence sources, owners, and timelines covering backend, frontend, infrastructure, and deployment tooling.
- **FR-002**: The program MUST maintain a control evidence catalog that links each control to collected artifacts (logs, screenshots, reports) and records assessment outcomes with severity ratings.
- **FR-003**: The review MUST produce a consolidated risk register summarizing findings, business impact, likelihood, compensating controls, and recommended remediation actions.
- **FR-004**: A remediation tracker MUST capture owners, target completion dates, verification steps, and references to related change artifacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, automation scripts).
- **FR-005**: Final reporting MUST include executive highlights, compliance mapping (e.g., OWASP, NIST, internal policies), and sign-off from security, engineering, and operations leadership.
- **FR-006**: The process MUST document dependencies on automated tooling (scanners, CI checks) and manual reviews, including escalation paths if tooling results are stale or unavailable.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Security Review Blueprint**: Master document describing scope, control catalog, evidence sources, responsible parties, and scheduling for the review cycle.
- **Control Evidence Catalog**: Structured repository capturing artifacts, timestamps, reviewers, outcomes, and severity of any deviations for each evaluated control.
- **Risk Register**: Aggregated record of identified risks with impact/likelihood scoring, affected systems, and recommended mitigations.
- **Remediation Tracker**: Action log linking findings to remediation tasks, owners, target dates, and verification procedures.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Complete the security review blueprint with stakeholder approval within 10 business days of kickoff.
- **SC-002**: Achieve 100% evidence coverage for in-scope controls, with all critical/high findings documented and triaged within 5 business days of discovery.
- **SC-003**: Secure formal sign-off from security, engineering, and operations leads on the final report, with no more than two revision cycles.
- **SC-004**: Ensure 100% of remediation items rated medium or higher have assigned owners and target completion dates within 15 business days, with progress tracked against release artifacts.

## Assumptions

- Current security documentation and tooling (logs, scanners, CI outputs) are available and accurately represent the production environment.
- Stakeholders responsible for control ownership can commit time to evidence collection and review within scheduled windows.
- The governance team maintains access to historical release artefacts for traceability.
- Compliance frameworks relevant to the suite (internal policies, industry standards) remain unchanged during the review cycle.

## Dependencies

- Access to security documentation (`SECURITY_*`, `ENHANCED_ERROR_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`) and automated scan results.
- Collaboration with engineering, DevOps, and operations teams to furnish evidence and validate findings.
- Reporting channels (internal communications or ticketing systems) for distributing the final report and tracking remediation.

## Out of Scope

- Implementing new security features or altering application code; the review documents current posture and findings only.
- Building automated remediation workflows beyond documenting manual processes and ownership.
- Certifying compliance with external regulators beyond summarizing alignment and gaps identified in the review.
