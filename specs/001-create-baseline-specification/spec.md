# Feature Specification: Create Baseline Specification

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-baseline-specification`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create baseline specification"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Establish baseline scope (Priority: P1)
A documentation owner compiles a single baseline specification that captures the current SupplyLine MRO Suite capabilities, security posture, and operational guarantees.

**Why this priority**: Without a comprehensive baseline, downstream teams lack a shared source of truth for planning and compliance reviews.

**Independent Test**: Reviewer can open the published baseline specification and verify that all mandated sections (capabilities, security, operations, release history) are present and current.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing product documentation, **When** the documentation owner drafts the baseline specification, **Then** the document summarizes every core module (inventory, calibration, chemical management, barcode/QR, reporting) with their business outcomes.
2. **Given** the repository governance rules, **When** the baseline specification is produced, **Then** it references the latest security, deployment, and release artefacts (`SECURITY_*`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`) so that stakeholders can trace compliance dependencies.

---

### User Story 2 - Align cross-functional stakeholders (Priority: P2)
Operations, security, and engineering leads review the baseline specification and formally record approval or requested revisions.

**Why this priority**: Coordinated sign-off ensures regulatory requirements and operational expectations are reflected before the document is adopted.

**Independent Test**: Audit observer can view the approval log showing each stakeholder’s decision date and outstanding actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the drafted baseline specification, **When** security and operations leads review it, **Then** their decisions (approve or request changes) are captured with dates and rationale.
2. **Given** requested revisions are addressed, **When** the approval log is updated, **Then** the document status reflects "Baseline Approved" with no outstanding blockers.

---

### User Story 3 - Enable downstream planning (Priority: P3)
Product and delivery teams reference the baseline specification to scope future features and confirm change impacts.

**Why this priority**: Keeping future work anchored to the baseline prevents scope drift and missed compliance obligations.

**Independent Test**: Feature planners can cite baseline sections when drafting new specifications, demonstrating that dependencies and constraints are addressed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team starts a new feature initiative, **When** they consult the baseline specification, **Then** they can identify required cross-team touchpoints and list them in their plan.
2. **Given** the baseline specification is updated, **When** planners revisit active feature documents, **Then** they log whether their plans stay aligned or require follow-up updates.

---

### Edge Cases

- Key artefacts (e.g., `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`) are outdated or missing when the baseline is drafted.
- A stakeholder required for approval is unavailable before the enforcement deadline.
- New regulatory or contractual obligations arise during review, forcing unscheduled updates to the baseline.

## Security & Compliance Impact *(mandatory)*

- No new secrets or credentials are introduced; the document must reiterate that all configuration changes remain governed by `SECURITY.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- The baseline must catalogue current security controls, audit intervals, and rate-limiting policies so reviews can trace them without scanning code.
- Document updates must highlight any observability or logging commitments that teams are expected to maintain in runtime scripts and deployment guides.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The baseline specification MUST outline each core SupplyLine MRO Suite capability (inventory, calibration, chemical management, barcode/QR workflows, reporting) with associated business outcomes and success measures.
- **FR-002**: The document MUST summarize the enforced security posture, including credential handling, authentication lifecycle rules, and audit cadence, referencing the authoritative security artefacts.
- **FR-003**: The baseline specification MUST include a change-propagation matrix that maps impacts across backend, frontend, migrations, automation scripts, and documentation for any future modification.
- **FR-004**: A stakeholder approval log MUST capture reviewer name, function, decision (approved / changes requested), decision date, and follow-up actions.
- **FR-005**: The baseline specification MUST be stored in the repository under `docs/` (or another agreed permanent location) with version control history and a visible revision summary.
- **FR-006**: The document MUST define measurable service or program-level benchmarks (e.g., release cadence, review SLAs, compliance checkpoints) that downstream teams must meet or cite when planning changes.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Baseline Specification Document**: Canonical narrative covering product capabilities, security posture, operational practices, release history, and change-propagation expectations.
- **Stakeholder Approval Log**: Record of reviews with stakeholder identity, function (operations, security, engineering), decision status, dates, and required follow-up actions.
- **Change-Propagation Matrix**: Summary table that links baseline components to impacted systems, serving as a reference for future planning and risk assessments.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Baseline specification published in the repository with stakeholder approval within 15 business days of project kickoff.
- **SC-002**: 100% of core modules (inventory, calibration, chemical management, barcode/QR, reporting) documented with clearly articulated business outcomes and dependencies.
- **SC-003**: At least 90% of newly created feature specs reference relevant sections of the baseline specification during their `/speckit.plan` Constitution Check.
- **SC-004**: Quarterly compliance review confirms the baseline specification satisfies current security and operational audit requirements without corrective actions.

## Assumptions

- Existing documentation (release notes, security guides, deployment procedures) is accurate enough to seed the baseline without full re-audits.
- Operations, security, and engineering leads are available to review and sign off within the defined timeline.
- The repository’s documentation structure (`docs/`, `SECURITY_*`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`) remains the authoritative source for process guidance.
- Future feature teams will be required to reference the baseline specification in their planning workflows.

## Dependencies

- Access to the latest `SECURITY_*` documents, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `VERSION.md` for accurate summarization.
- Collaboration time from stakeholders who own security, operations, and engineering approval responsibilities.
- Documentation tooling or templates (e.g., Markdown conventions, review checklists) currently used by the SupplyLine MRO Suite team.

## Out of Scope

- Implementing new application functionality or modifying existing backend/frontend services.
- Redefining security controls or operational processes beyond summarizing their current state.
- Automating approval workflows or building new review tooling; manual or existing processes will be used.
