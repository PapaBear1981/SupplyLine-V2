# Quick Start Guide - User Management Refactoring

## Overview
This guide will help you quickly get started with testing the new Roles and Departments management features.

## Prerequisites
- Backend server running
- Frontend development server running
- Admin user credentials

## Starting the Application

### Backend
```bash
cd SupplyLine-MRO-Suite/backend
# Activate virtual environment if needed
python app.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd SupplyLine-MRO-Suite/frontend
npm start
```

## Quick Test Flow

### 1. Access User Management (30 seconds)
1. Log in as an administrator
2. Navigate to User Management page
3. Look for the button group in the top-right:
   - **"Add New User"** (unchanged)
   - **"Roles"** (renamed from "Create Role")
   - **"Departments"** (renamed from "Create Department")

### 2. Test Departments Management (2 minutes)

1. Click **"Departments"** button
2. You should see a modal with a table of all departments
3. Try the search box - type "Materials"

15. Read the warning and click **"Delete Permanently"**
16. Verify the department is gone

### 3. Test Roles Management (3 minutes)

#### Quick Test:
1. Click **"Roles"** button
2. You should see a modal with a table of all roles
3. Notice the system roles have a "System Role" badge

5. Click **"Add New Role"**
6. On the "Role Details" tab:
   - Name: "Test Role"
   - Description: "This is a test role"
7. Switch to the "Permissions" tab
8. Expand the "User Management" category
9. Select a few permissions (e.g., user.view, user.create)
10. Notice the permission count updates
11. Click **"Add Role"**
12. Find your new role in the list
13. Click the **"Permissions"** button (shield icon)
14. Add more permissions from different categories
15. Click **"Save Permissions"**
16. Notice the permission count updates in the table
17. Click the **edit** button (pencil icon)
18. Change the description
19. Click **"Save Changes"**
20. Click the **delete** button (trash icon)
21. Confirm deletion

### 4. Test System Role Protection (1 minute)

1. In the Roles modal, find "Administrator" role
2. Notice it has a "System Role" badge
3. Try to click the **edit** button - it should be there but...
4. Click the **"Permissions"** button - this SHOULD work
5. Modify some permissions
6. Click **"Save Permissions"** - this SHOULD work
7. Try to click the **delete** button - it should be disabled/hidden

## Visual Checklist

### Departments Modal Should Have:
- ✅ Search box at the top
- ✅ "Add New Department" button
- ✅ Table with columns: Name, Description, Status, Actions
- ✅ Active/Inactive badges
- ✅ Three action buttons per row: Edit, Toggle Active, Delete
- ✅ Smooth animations on hover
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for delete

### Roles Modal Should Have:
- ✅ Search box at the top
- ✅ "Add New Role" button
- ✅ Table with columns: Role Name, Description, Permissions, Type, Actions
- ✅ Permission count badges
- ✅ System Role badges for system roles
- ✅ Three action buttons: Permissions, Edit, Delete
- ✅ Edit and Delete disabled for system roles
- ✅ Permissions button enabled for all roles

### Permission Tree Should Have:
- ✅ Categories that expand/collapse
- ✅ Category icons showing selection state (all/partial/none)
- ✅ "Select All" / "Deselect All" per category
- ✅ Individual permission checkboxes
- ✅ Permission descriptions
- ✅ Total count at the bottom
- ✅ Global "Clear All" and "Select All" buttons

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Buttons not showing
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a user with `user.manage` and `role.manage` permissions

### Issue: Modal not opening
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Make sure backend is running.

### Issue: Changes not saving
**Solution**: Check network tab for failed requests. Verify backend is running and accessible.

### Issue: Permission tree not loading
**Solution**: Verify the `/api/permissions/categories` endpoint is working. Check backend logs.

### Issue: Can't delete system roles
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. System roles are protected from deletion.

### Issue: Styling looks broken
**Solution**: Make sure all CSS files are loaded. Check browser console for 404 errors.

## API Endpoints to Verify

# Get all departments (including inactive)
GET http://localhost:5000/api/departments?include_inactive=true

# Update department
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1
Body: {"name": "Updated", "description": "Updated desc"}

# Soft delete (deactivate)
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1

# Hard delete (permanent)
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1/hard-delete
```

### Roles

# Update role (including permissions)
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/roles/1
Body: {"permissions": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

# Delete role

```

### Permissions
